# User Behavior Classification Based on Mobile Usage Patterns

This repository contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models to classify user behavior based on mobile usage patterns. The dataset used for training and testing is based on mobile usage data, including features like app usage time, screen on time, battery drain, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply various machine learning algorithms to predict user behavior classes using data collected from mobile devices. The models are trained on features like app usage time, screen on time, battery drain, number of apps installed, data usage, and the user's age. The models used include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, and cross-validation is applied to evaluate performance.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
